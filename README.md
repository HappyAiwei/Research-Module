# Research-Module

## The code for real data is in the file named "RealDataApplication.R".

## The code for Monte Carlo simulation to explore finite sample behavior is in file "Figures.R".

## The file "HypothesisTest.R" contains the code and some markdown of the test statistics to determine the model parameter-   setting.

## All functions ,that were used in simulation study, are put into file "RM_functions.R" 

## In order to save time (since it would take a week to finish running the files "Figures.R" and 4 "model*.R"), we provide some intermediate results in dropbox      https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2y3d3kunlmxog3o/AABDC2pYfmkVsiio9qgql419a?dl=0
